## KS-lib/games

This is a public repository for games written in kerboscript.

### Basic layout

Each game has it's own sub folder for ease of organization.
Within each folder there will be a `.ks` file of the same name as the folder that you can `RUN` to play the game and a README written using ascii text, or Github markdown files (.md) that contains some basic info about the game.
Additionally there may also be needed libraries for the game, which can either be placed in the game folder or linked to in the README file for the game.

A short summary of each game can be found [HERE](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KSLib/blob/master/games/SUMMARY.md)

### Contributing

If you wish to contribute a game it must be something that is in the public domain.

All contributed games fall under the same licensing as all other code in this repository as out lined [HERE](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KSLib/blob/master/README.md#licensing)
