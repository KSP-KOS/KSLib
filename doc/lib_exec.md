## lib_exec

This library is a powerful tool for unhardcoding program's behavior.
As far as I know it works fine in all possible special cases.

### execute

args:
  * command - a command or a sequence of commands to execute.
    example: "list files in f_list. print f_list[0].". Note:
    the command should end with `.` (dot).

description:
  * Execute a command.

example:
  `execute("set x to 42. print x.").`
  
caveat #1:
  * run command in the current version of kOS works in a weird way:
```
run foo.
delete foo.
rename bar to foo.
run foo.  // will still run the first version of foo
```
  * lib_exec can't fix it:
```
execute("run foo.").
delete foo.
rename bar to foo.
execute("run foo.").  // will still run the first version of foo
```
  * you'll have to change the name of file every time if you want it to be recompiled

caveat #2:
  * the command will be executed in the global scope. i.e. this won't work:
```
{
  local my_example_var is 42.
  execute("print my_example_var.").
}
```

##### The same caveats apply to other functions from this library.

### evaluate

args:
  * expression - an expression to evaluate. Unlike "command" parameter from function
    `execute` an expression should **not** end with dot: `evaluate("7 * a + 2").`.

returns:
  * result - result of expression evaluation.

description:
  * Evaluate an expression.

example:
  `print evaluate("x*x + x + 8").`

### evaluate_function

args:
  * function_name - string, a name of function to evaluate
  * parameter_list - list of anything, parameters to pass to the function

returns:
  * result - result of function evaluation.

example:
  `print evaluate_function("foo", list(42, true, "hello")).`
  does exactly the same as:
  `print foo(42, true, "hello").`

### useful tips

* Compilation is a slow process. Each call of lib_exec's functions causes
  a compilation. If you want to speed your main loop up try this techinque:
  ```
  lock my_expr to 0.  // or kOS compiler won't threat my_expr as locked
  execute("lock my_expr to x*x + x + 8."). // insert your expression here
  set done to false.
  until done {
    print my_expr.  // insert your main loop code here
  }
  ```

* If for some weird reason you don't want to use this library, a simple mediator
  helps in some simple cases (but fails in others):

  mediator.ks:
  ```
  run foo.
  ```
  main.ks:
  ```
  run mediator.
  delete foo.
  rename bar to foo.
  run mediator.  // actually runs the second version
  ```

  P.S. If the "mediator" above doesn't work for you, don't ask me why, just use
  lib_exec.
