## `lib_location_constants`

The `lib_location_constants.ks` library provides geolocations for places that would be relatively easy to locate for players flying manually (i.e., without the use of scripting mods such as kOS).
The locations in this file are not authoritative; feel free to submit updates if you find them inaccurate.
Additions (new locations, including on bodies other than Kerbin or even on non-stock bodies such as Earth or Gael) are welcome,
but you are advised to check with the KSLib developers (e.g., by submitting a feature request) before adding locations of easter eggs that were originally intended to be difficult to locate.

### Default names

If there is a defined default location for your solar system in the lib then 

* `location_constants:runway_start` is the default location where airplanes normally spawn.
* `location_constants:reverse_runway_start` is the other end of the runway where airplanes normally spawn.
* `location_constants:launchpad` is the default location where rockets normally spawn.

### Runway naming conventions

More detailed locations are described using the runway heading standards.
[Wikipedia passage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway#Runway_headings)
as of 6 Sept 2020:

>  A runway numbered 09 points east (90°), runway 18 is south (180°), runway 27 points west (270°) and runway 36 points to the north (360° rather than 0°). When taking off from or landing on runway 09, a plane is heading around 90° (east). A runway can normally be used in both directions, and is named for each direction separately: e.g., "runway 15" in one direction is "runway 33" when used in the other. The two numbers differ by 18 (= 180°).

### Kerbin locations

If using the stock KSP solar system or the JNSQ system, the default locations are on Kerbin. The exact locations are defined below as `location_constants:launchpad`, `location_constants:runway_start` and `location_constants:reverse_runway_start`.

#### Vertical landing locations

* `location_constants:launchpad`: alias for `launchpad`
* `location_constants:kerbin:launchpad`: the geolocation of the launchpad
* `location_constants:kerbin:woomerang_launchpad`: the geolocation of the Woomerang launchpad (northern launchpad surrounded by mountains)
* `location_constants:kerbin:dessert_launchpad`: alias for `desert_launchpad`
* `location_constants:kerbin:desert_launchpad`: the launchpad in the Dessert Airfield location, which is in the middle of the desert.
* `location_constants:kerbin:VAB`: the geolocation of the double helipad on top of the VAB. Don't land here if you care about the safety of your Kerbals at all (although the same could be said for playing KSP).
  Warning: landing here will **not** allow you to recover 100% funds.


#### Horizontal landing locations

* `location_constants:runway_start`: alias for `runway_09_start`
* `location_constants:reverse_runway_start`: alias for `runway_27_start`.

* `location_constants:kerbin:dessert_runway_18_start`: alias for `desert_runway_18_start`
* `location_constants:kerbin:desert_runway_18_start`: start of the desert runway when heading south. Roughly where planes spawn when "Dessert Airfield" is selected (only possible if you have the Making History DLC and have adjusted your difficulty settings to allow spawning in other sites).
* `location_constants:kerbin:dessert_runway_18_end`: alias for `desert_runway_36_start`
* `location_constants:kerbin:desert_runway_18_end`: alias for `desert_runway_36_start`
* `location_constants:kerbin:dessert_runway_36_start`: alias for `desert_runway_36_start`
* `location_constants:kerbin:desert_runway_36_start`: start of the desert runway when heading north.
* `location_constants:kerbin:desert_runway_36_end`: alias for `desert_runway_18_start`
* `location_constants:kerbin:dessert_runway_36_end`: alias for `desert_runway_18_start`
* `location_constants:kerbin:island_runway_09_start`: start of the island runway when heading east.
  Warning: landing here will **not** allow you to recover 100% funds.
* `location_constants:kerbin:island_runway_09_end`: alias for `island_runway_27_start`
* `location_constants:kerbin:island_runway_27_start`: start of the island runway when heading west.
  Warning: landing here will **not** allow you to recover 100% funds.
* `location_constants:kerbin:island_runway_27_end`: alias for `island_runway_09_start`
* `location_constants:kerbin:l1_runway_09_start`: where the KSC runway starts when it has never been upgraded at all
  (still made of dirt).
* `location_constants:kerbin:l1_runway_09_end`: alias for `l1_runway_27_start`
* `location_constants:kerbin:l1_runway_27_start`: start of the un-upgraded (dirt) runway when heading west.
* `location_constants:kerbin:l1_runway_27_end`: alias for `l1_runway_09_start`
* `location_constants:kerbin:l2_runway_09_start`: where the KSC runway starts when upgraded once (paved, but with potholes and not lined with lights).
* `location_constants:kerbin:l2_runway_09_end`: alias for `l2_runway_27_start`
* `location_constants:kerbin:l2_runway_27_start`: start of the partly upgraded (potholed) runway when heading west.
* `location_constants:kerbin:l2_runway_27_end`: alias for `l2_runway_09_start`
* `location_constants:kerbin:runway_09_start`: start of the fully upgraded KSC runway.
* `location_constants:kerbin:runway_09_end`: alias for `runway_27_start`
* `location_constants:kerbin:runway_27_start`: start of the KSC runway when heading west.
* `location_constants:kerbin:runway_27_end`: alias for `runway_09_start` west (toward the mountains).
* `location_constants:kerbin:runway_09_overrun`: The "lip" of the fully-upgraded KSC runway. Certain plane designs that can maintain level flight but cannot pitch up while landed should start pitching up when their wheels pass `runway_09_end`, since the lip will leave them airborne for a moment.
* `location_constants:kerbin:runway_27_overrun`: The lip of the fully-upgraded KSC runway when headed toward the mountains. Mostly included for symmetry.
