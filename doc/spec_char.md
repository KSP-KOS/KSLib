## spec_char

A small "hack" to insert quote character and next line character into strings.
**important:**
  * This library is a .ksm file and is placed in the library_ksm folder.
  * This solution is temporary. A way to get these symbols in kerboscript
    will be introduced soon.
  * Because it is .ksm file it might stop working in some future versions of kOS.

### quote

A global variable set to a value of one quote.

### endl

A global variable set to a line feed symbol
