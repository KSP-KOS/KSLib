## spec_char

`spec_char.ksm` was a small "hack" to insert quote character and next line character into strings.

**important:**
  * This library is a .ksm file and is placed in the library_ksm folder.
  * This solution is no longer needed thanks the the new [char()](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC//math/basic.html?#function:CHAR) function added to kOS.

### quote

A global variable set to a value of one quote.

### endl

A global variable set to a line feed symbol.

### beep

A global variable that sounds a beep in the ingame and any connected telnet terminals.
