# KSLib
A user-community supported standard library for the Kerboscript language 

The contents of this repository are scripts intended for use
with the [kOS (Kerbal Operating System) mod](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS)
for Kerbal Space Program.

The scripts are written in the Kerboscript language, which is described
on the [main documentation page for kOS](https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/).

The goal of this repository is twofold:

  1. To allow the developers of the kOS mod a place to put standard
     library scripts that enhance the usability of the mod.
  2. To allow users of the kOS mod a place to participate as a group,
     submitting their own helpful additions to the library of scripts.

Please see the file: HOWTO.md to see how to use the files in this
repository.

Please see the file: SUMMARY.md about the available libraries and what type of 
functionality they provide.

### Contributing
To contribute programs, libraries, program code, or examples of program code to this repository you must license the work under the [MIT license](LICENSE).  The act of contributing implies your consent to this stipulation.

For the **attribution** requirement of the license, you need only
attribute the KSLib team as a single group.  You will not have to

the entire attribution fit in a single short comment line.

### Why the MIT License?
The main kOS mod has been released under version 3 of the [GNU General Public License (GPLv3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), but KSLib has chosen the [MIT License](LICENSE) instead.  Why?

  1. MOSTLY THIS ONE -> The GNU GPL is verbose.  Applying it significantly increases the size of each Kerboscript source code file, unnecessarily occupying precious kOS disk capacity.
  2. Casual Kerboscript programmers who just want to do something small and simple may find the GNU GPL intimidating.
