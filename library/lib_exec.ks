// The mess below declares a function execute that executes a command from it's string representation.
// I'm 95% sure there is no easy way to achieve this behavior in the current version of kOS (0.17).
// All easier solutions I know fail to work as expected in a range of special cases.
// If you think you know an easy way to implement it there are unit tests
// in KSLib/unit_tests/lib_exec to test your implementation.
// See "run is weird" for more detailed information: [link is coming soon (tm)]
