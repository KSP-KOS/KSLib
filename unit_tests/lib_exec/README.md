## unit_tests/lib_exec

A unit test for all edge cases of lib_exec I know.

**ATTENTION:** The test is split into several files for the purity of the experiment.
**DO NOT** run them from one script and **DO NOT** merge them into one file.
run all three tests from the terminal.

### instructions:
* copy all files from "unit_tests/lib_exec/" and "library/lib_exec.ks"
  to the archive ("<ksp_folder>/Ships/Script")
* switch to 0.
* run test_lib_exec_1.
* run test_lib_exec_2.
* run test_lib_exec_3.

### what to expect:
If all works fine after every test "test finished successfully" will be printed
to the screen. If something is broken you'll get an exception.

### bonus:
Check out lib_testing. It might help you write your own unit tests.
